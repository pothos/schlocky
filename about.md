**Hello,**

I'm a little example blog, rendered with [schlocky](https://github.com/pothos/schlocky).

Read the [blog posts](?)!

There are also some files in a [subfolder](?i=other-example/).
Fun fact, you can also render the [README.md](?i=README) or the `index.md` as stored in the [GitHub repo](?i=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pothos/schlocky/main/index.md) (but absolute movement leads back to this site), or how about the [Rust contribution guide](?i=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rust-lang/rust/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).
